## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on Replit as a React-only frontend:

1. **Development**: `vite --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173` - Runs only the Vite development server
2. **Build**: `vite build` - Builds the React application for production
3. **Production**: `vite preview` - Serves the built static files
4. **Static Assets**: CV and other files served from the public directory

### Environment Configuration
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment flag for development/production modes
- **REPL_ID**: Replit-specific environment variable for development features

The application includes Replit-specific optimizations like runtime error overlays and development banners for enhanced development experience.
